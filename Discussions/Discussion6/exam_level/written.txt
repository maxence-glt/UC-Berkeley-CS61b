1    Q. Give the runtime of f1 and f2.

     A. f1 is T(N^2) since its basically 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + inf which is N(N-1)/2
        f2 is T(N) since it crows slower than 2N and faster than 0.5N

2    Q. For each of the arrays write weather it could be an array of a
        weighted quick union with path compression

     A. A. No, as there is no element that is tracking the size
           of the sets

        B. No, the tree that has its root at 0 would not connect to 9

        C. No, since we are using weighted quick union the tree would
           not be that tall

        D. Yes, tree height is fine, no cycling

        E. No, the 9-8-6-1-0 is too tall

        F. No, too tall

3(a) Q. Suppose we have a WQU without path compression with N elements

     A. 1. What is the runtime in big Omega and big O of isConnected?

           Omega(1), O(log(N))

        2. What is the runtime in big Omega and big O of connect?

           Same as above since you use find

 (b) Q. What is the runtime of addToWQU in big Omega and big O?

     A. Omega(N), O(N^2 log(N))

 (c) Q. What is the max and min number of matching size connections...

     A. min 1, max N - 1
